## Status: IN PROGRESS
Started: 2025-06-17 14:45 PST
Deadline: 2025-06-18 04:45 PST (14 hours)

## Critical Issues (Priority Order)

### CAR-001: Type System Violations ✅ FIXED
**Location**: packages/executor/src/auth.ts:32
**Issue**: Using `any` type cast in error handling
**Impact**: Violates no-any rule, potential runtime errors
**Fix**: Implement exhaustive type checking with TypeScript's never type
**Resolution**: 
- Replaced `(auth as any).type` with proper exhaustiveness checking using `never` type
- Added comprehensive JSDoc explaining the pattern
- Created behavioral tests verifying all auth types are handled
- Tests confirm compile-time exhaustiveness and runtime error handling
- All 21 tests passing

### CAR-002: Memory Bomb Waiting to Happen ✅ FIXED
**Location**: packages/executor/src/action-executor-jobs.ts:~300
**Issue**: No streaming support, entire responses loaded into memory
**Impact**: Process crash with large responses
**Fix**: Implement streaming with size limits
**Resolution**:
- Added default 50MB response size limit (configurable per API)
- Implemented response body truncation in trace logs (1KB max)
- Added streaming support foundation for future enhancement
- Created comprehensive memory safety tests
- All 10 memory safety tests passing
- Memory usage now bounded even with malicious APIs

### CAR-003: Error Context Information Leakage ✅ FIXED
**Location**: packages/executor/src/http.ts:multiple
**Issue**: Raw error objects in contexts leak sensitive data
**Impact**: Security - credential/token leakage
**Fix**: Whitelist error context fields explicitly
**Resolution**:
- Implemented URL sanitization removing query parameters
- Added header sanitization with explicit whitelist/blacklist
- Created response data sanitization for error contexts
- Enhanced trace truncation with pattern-based redaction
- Fixed response body leaks in action-executor-jobs.ts
- All 10 security tests passing
- No sensitive data appears in logs or error contexts

### CAR-004: Incomplete JSON Schema Conversion ✅ FIXED
**Location**: packages/executor/src/validation.ts:166
**Issue**: Falls back to z.unknown() silently
**Impact**: Runtime type errors in production
**Fix**: Either support properly or throw unsupported error
**Resolution**:
- Replaced z.unknown() fallback with explicit error throwing
- Added support for const and enum at root level
- Added support for union types (type: ['string', 'null'])
- Enhanced string format validation with proper errors
- Added comprehensive validation security tests
- All 14 validation tests passing
- Schema validation now fails fast on unsupported features

### CAR-005: Network Error Categorization Too Simplistic ✅ FIXED
**Location**: packages/executor/src/http.ts:180-195
**Issue**: Lumps different failure modes together
**Impact**: Incorrect retry behavior
**Fix**: Granular error categorization
**Resolution**:
- Enhanced categorizeNetworkError to return detailed categorization
- Added error subtypes for granular classification
- Implemented retry delay hints based on error type
- Distinguished DNS, TCP, TLS, and timeout errors
- Added specific suggestions for each error subtype
- Extracted retry-after headers from 429 responses
- Tests verify categorization behavior

### CAR-006: Circular Reference Detection Without Path Reporting ✅ FIXED
**Location**: packages/executor/src/references.ts:65-70
**Issue**: No cycle path in error message
**Impact**: Hard to debug circular references
**Fix**: Track and report full cycle path
**Resolution**:
- Enhanced error messages to show complete cycle path
- Added visual indicators (arrows) for clarity
- Marked cycle start and end points clearly
- Multi-line formatting for better readability
- Added explanatory text about why cycles are problematic
- Tests verify clear error messages
- All 3 circular detection tests passing

### CAR-007: OAuth2 Token Refresh Logic Oversimplified ✅ FIXED
**Location**: packages/executor/src/auth.ts:89-96
**Issue**: No handling for refresh token expiry or rotation
**Impact**: Auth failures in production
**Fix**: Implement proper OAuth2 state machine
**Resolution**:
- Implemented refresh token rotation support
- Added rate limiting (10s minimum between refresh attempts)
- Enhanced error categorization (invalid_grant, network errors, etc.)
- Added clock skew tolerance (1 minute buffer)
- Proper OAuth2 error responses per RFC 6749
- Clear re-authentication guidance when refresh fails
- All 17 OAuth2 tests passing

### CAR-008: Missing Request Deduplication ✅ FIXED
**Location**: packages/executor/src/action-executor-jobs.ts:general
**Issue**: Same action can execute multiple times concurrently
**Impact**: Race conditions, duplicate API calls
**Fix**: Add deduplication based on action ID + input hash
**Resolution**:
- Created deduplication module with content-based hashing
- SHA-256 hash of action type + inputs + dependencies
- In-memory cache with TTL support (5 min default)
- Pending requests block duplicates until completion
- Failed requests allow immediate retry
- Integrated into executeActionRun with early return for duplicates
- All 18 deduplication tests passing

### CAR-009: Binary Response Handling Assumptions ✅ FIXED
**Location**: packages/executor/src/action-executor-jobs.ts:294
**Issue**: Assumes Buffer.from() always works
**Impact**: Crashes on complex objects
**Fix**: Content-type checking and proper serialization
**Resolution**:
- Created dedicated binary-handler module
- Handles all data types: Buffer, ArrayBuffer, TypedArrays, strings, objects
- Detects and properly decodes base64 strings
- Graceful error handling with fallbacks
- Size limit enforcement (100MB max)
- Comprehensive type checking before conversion
- All 25 binary handler tests passing

### CAR-010: No Circuit Breaker Pattern ✅ FIXED
**Location**: packages/executor/src/http.ts:general
**Issue**: Keeps hitting dead APIs
**Impact**: Cascade failures, wasted resources
**Fix**: Implement circuit breaker with cooldown
**Resolution**:
- Created circuit-breaker module with 3-state pattern
- Per-host tracking to isolate failures
- Sliding window for failure rate calculation (50% threshold)
- Exponential backoff for repeated failures
- Half-open state for gradual recovery
- Integrated into HttpClient.executeWithRetry()
- Fast failure with clear error messages
- All 19 circuit breaker tests passing

### CAR-011: Function Too Large ✅ FIXED
**Location**: packages/executor/src/action-executor-jobs.ts:executeActionRun
**Issue**: 400+ line function
**Impact**: Hard to test and maintain
**Fix**: Decompose into phases
**Resolution**:
- Created action-executor-phases module with 8 focused phases
- Each phase has single responsibility and consistent error handling
- Phases are independently testable with clear interfaces
- Main function reduced to orchestration logic
- Phase approach enables better debugging and modification
- Error handling is now consistent across all phases
- All 16 phase tests passing

### CAR-012: Storage Provider Interface Assumptions ✅ FIXED
**Location**: packages/executor/src/interfaces.ts:5-7
**Issue**: Assumes always-available storage
**Impact**: No handling for storage failures
**Fix**: Add error types and retry guidance
**Resolution**:
- Created enhanced storage interface with comprehensive error types
- Implemented StorageError class with retry guidance
- Distinguished transient vs permanent failures
- Added error categorization for network, rate limit, quota, permission errors
- Updated action executor to handle storage failures gracefully
- Storage failures don't fail actions - outputs marked as ephemeral
- Created StorageAdapter for gradual migration from legacy interface
- All 25 storage tests passing (15 enhanced + 10 error handling)
