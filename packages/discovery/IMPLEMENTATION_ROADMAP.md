## Conclusion

The zero-generation approach is revolutionary but requires careful implementation. By following this roadmap, Rainmaker Discovery can become the standard way developers build applications - not by generating code, but by composing proven patterns.

**Remember Carmack's wisdom**: "Make it work, make it right, make it fast." We've made it work. Now we make it right. Speed will follow.
