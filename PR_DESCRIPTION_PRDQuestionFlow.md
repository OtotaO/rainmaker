# Fix PRD Question Flow with Create PRD Now Button

## Summary
This PR fixes a critical issue where the PRD question flow would repeat the third question instead of proceeding to generate the PRD. The implementation adds robust error handling and a direct "Create PRD Now" button to improve user experience.

## Implementation Details

The implementation includes several key improvements:

### Frontend Components
- Modified `usePRDQuestionFlow.tsx` to handle missing AI responses gracefully
- Added fallback mechanisms to use user inputs when AI responses are unavailable
- Added a "Create PRD Now" button in `PRDQuestionFlow.tsx` for direct PRD creation

### Error Handling
- Implemented robust error handling in `generatePRD()` function
- Added fallback PRD creation for when API calls fail
- Ensured the flow can continue even with partial or missing data

### Documentation
- Updated frontend README.md to document the changes
- Added detailed comments to explain the fallback mechanisms

## Testing

The implementation has been manually tested to verify:

- The PRD question flow now properly proceeds after the third question
- The "Create PRD Now" button allows direct progression to PRD creation
- Error handling correctly recovers from API failures
- The user experience is smooth and consistent

All functionality works as expected in the following scenarios:
- Normal flow with all AI responses working
- Flow with some AI responses failing
- Direct progression using the "Create PRD Now" button

## Usage

After merging this PR, product managers will experience a more reliable PRD creation flow:

1. Answer the three PRD questions as before
2. After the third question, either:
   - Click "Submit" to process the answer and automatically proceed to PRD creation
   - Click "Create PRD Now" to skip additional AI processing and create a PRD right away

## Additional Notes

- This fix maintains backward compatibility with existing code
- The implementation is resilient to API failures, ensuring users can always complete their workflow
- The UI improvements provide clear guidance to users on how to proceed
